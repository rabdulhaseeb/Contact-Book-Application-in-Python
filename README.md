Building a Contact Book Application in Python:

As part of my continuous learning and exploration of Python, I recently developed a simple yet functional Contact Book application. This project allowed me to dive deeper into Python's core functionalities, specifically focusing on defining and managing functions, handling user inputs, and manipulating data structures such as lists and dictionaries. Below, Iâ€™ve provided a detailed explanation of the code and its functionality.

Project Overview:
The Contact Book application is a console-based program that enables users to add, remove, edit, and view contacts. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and data storage using lists and dictionaries.

Features:
1. Add Contact: Users can add a new contact by providing details such as name, number, address, and relation.
2. Remove Contact: Users can remove an existing contact by specifying the contact's name.
3. Edit Contact: Users can update the details of an existing contact.
4. Show Contacts: Users can view all the contacts stored in the contact book.
5. Exit: Users can exit the application.

Function Descriptions:
1. addContact: This function prompts the user for the contact's name, number, address, and relation. It then creates a dictionary with these details and appends it to the contacts list.
2. removeContact: This function asks the user for the name of the contact to remove. It searches the contacts list for a match and removes the corresponding contact if found.
3. editContact: This function prompts the user for the name of the contact to edit. If the contact is found, it allows the user to update the number, address, and relation of the contact.

main: This function displays the main menu and handles the user's choices by calling the appropriate functions. It runs in a loop until the user decides to exit the application.

Learning Outcomes:
1. Function Definition and Calls: Improved understanding of defining functions and calling them within other functions or loops.
2. User Input Handling: Gained experience in taking and processing user inputs.
3. Data Manipulation: Learned to create, update, and delete data stored in lists and dictionaries.
4. Control Structures: Enhanced skills in using loops and conditional statements to control the flow of the program.

Conclusion:
This Contact Book project was a great opportunity to apply Python programming concepts in a practical scenario. It provided hands-on experience in function management, data handling, and user interaction within a console application. I look forward to expanding this project by adding more features such as data persistence using file handling or databases, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
